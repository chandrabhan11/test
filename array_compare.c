/*
Problem Statement:

Write a C program that takes two arrays as input and determines whether they are equal or not. 
The program should compare the elements of both arrays and return true if they have the same elements in any order, and false otherwise.

Inputs:

Two arrays A[] and B[] of integers.
The size of the arrays N, where N represents the number of elements in each array.
Output:
True if the arrays A[] and B[] are equal, false otherwise.

Example:
-------------
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1, 2, 5}
B[] = {2, 5, 1}

Output:
True
-------------
Input:
A[] = {1, 2, 5, 1}
B[] = {2, 5, 1, 2}

Output:
False
-------------
Input:
A[] = {1, 2, 5, 1}
B[] = {2, 5, 1, 5}

Output:
False
-------------
Note:

- The program should handle arrays of any size.
- The order of elements in the arrays does not matter for determining equality.
- The program should provide the correct output for all possible valid inputs.
